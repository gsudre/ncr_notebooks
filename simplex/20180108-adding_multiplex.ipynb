This is a bit weird to me, especially if we are going to make this comparison here. She said simplex is only within nuclear families. So, I'll have to trim the simplex analysis to remove those families, or at least be careful not to include them in both categories. **\n",

Since they haven't sent one yet, I'll go ahead and run the old pipeline. At least the scripts will be ready, but I'll need to delete all this data, because it's almost 10Tb of data."
